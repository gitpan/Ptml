=head1

this PERL routine defines various data structures for use by the PTML
examples.  In a real application the main PERL module would create useful 
data structures to be merged into the template.  In this example we simply
define a few examples structures to make the examples work.

@SampleList=(One,Word,At,A,Time);
@SampleNames=(Joe,Fred,Sally,Sue);

@SampleListOfLists=("The first item","The second item",
                   ["item3.1","item3.2", ["thing3.3.1","and thing 3.3.2"] ],
                   "Last item (number four)" );

chop($ourDir = `pwd`);
$ourDir = '.' if not $ourDir;

# return TRUE to our caller
